          <br><br>

          The 2 main categories of weight loss are fast weight loss and slow weight loss. 
          <br><br>
          Clinical studies from the National Institutes of Health show advantages of slow weight loss over fast weight
          loss, including retention of muscle (less atrophy) and maintenance of the weight lost.
          <br><br>
          In addition, by training your metabolism to perform utilizing nature’s science, you reap the benefits of
          weight loss continuously into the future. 
          <br><br>
          It’s great to lose the weight, it is devastating to regain the weight you lost.  Let your body do the work
          with the No-Pain Weight Loss Program.

              Ketosis is a metabolic state that occurs when your body burns fat for energy instead of glucose.  
              <br><br>
              Most have heard of the keto diet where you consume high fats (proteins) while restricting your intake of
              carbs (sugars). This diet triggers your body to burn fats for energy vs burning sugars, a process called
              ketosis. Albeit a good method of food restrictive diet, it is very expensive, extremely difficult to
              maintain, and very easy to reverse the benefits by consuming too many carbs.

                compound called chlorogenic acid. This compound is believed to contribute to several potential health

<strong>Shipping Policy</strong>
<br> <br>
<strong>Supplements & Fitness products:</strong>
<br><br>
NO-PAIN ships orders of supplements & fitness products to addresses in the United States (its territories) and Canada only. We ship all orders within 7 business days. <br> <br>
Orders are shipped via DHL, USPS, UPS, FEDEX or other comparable shippers. <br> <br>
US Orders: We offer free shipping on all orders to all US addresses (typical delivery time frame is 5 business days based on when the package leaves our shipping location).
<br><br>
Canada Orders (when available): The cost of shipping to all addresses within Canada is $25.00 USD. This fee covers shipping, duties, and taxes. Delivery time to Canada is typically 7-10 business days.
<br> <br>
<strong>Non-perishable food products: </strong>
<br><br>
NO-PAIN ships orders of non-perishable food products to addresses in the United States and its territories only. We cannot ship food products to Canada. We ship all orders within 1-4 business days. <br><br>
Orders are shipped via DHL, USPS, UPS, FEDEX or other comparable shippers. All shipments can be tracked online. Tracking instructions will be provided in your shipping confirmation email. <br><br>
We offer free shipping on all orders to all US addresses (typical delivery time frame is 2-5 business days based on when the package leaves our shipping location). <br><br>
Some orders may be offered FedEx 2 Business-Day shipping for an additional fee. (This option is not available for all orders). If you choose this shipping method, please note that, if possible, the order will be shipped the same day. However, if your order is placed on a weekend or in the afternoon your order may not be shipped until the next business day. The day that the package ships does not count as a business day (for shipping purposes) because the package does not leave the warehouse until the end of the day. For example - orders shipped on Monday will arrive on Wednesday. FedEx 2 business day delivery does not include weekends. In some areas of the country FedEx delivers these packages over the weekend but it is not guaranteed, and weekends are not counted as business days. For example, orders shipped on Thursday will arrive on Monday by FedEx.

Promo code coupons have no cash value, and may have an expiration date, and are void where prohibited or restricted by law. You are responsible for any applicable sales tax related to the use of a promo code coupon. The coupon offer is offered for a limited time and, for products, if product is available. We have the right to modify or cancel a coupon at any time. The coupon applies only to qualifying items displaying the coupon offer on the item detail page. <br><br>
<strong>Digital Scale. Limited Warranty:</strong> <br><br>
We shall have no obligation with respect to a warranty claim unless notified of such claim within the Digital Scale 60 Day Limited Warranty Period. The Digital Scale Limited Warranty does not extend, and shall not apply, to any defects in the product resulting in whole or in part from accident, neglect, abuse or misuse, willful damage, misconduct, recklessness, negligence, or any alteration, modification or repair to the product by anyone other than us or use of the product for purposes other than those intended by NO-PAIN as described in the product documentation. Damage to or failure of the product caused in whole or in part by use of non-NO-PAIN supplied or non-NO-PAIN approved repair or replacement parts will not be covered by this warranty.
 <br> <br>
<strong>Refund policy</strong>
<br><br>
<h4 class="fw-bold">Return Policy and Money Back Guarantee:</h4>
<br><br>
<strong>Supplements </strong>
<br><br>
All NO-PAIN supplements come with a 60-day money back guarantee. This money back guarantee is good for first time orders of a Product only and is limited to one return per customer per Product. The 60-day period begins on the day you receive the Product. If the Product you receive is damaged in shipping, you may return it for a full refund, or we will ship you a replacement Product.
<br><br>
<strong>Return Authorization Process</strong> <br><br>
 If you wish to make a return within the allotted timeframe, please send an email to support@no-pain.works, for a return authorization number and return instructions.  It is important that you contact us before returning any Product to ensure that you are eligible for a refund; returned items that are not eligible for a refund will not be processed and replacement product will not be shipped (or refund given) back to you. We reserve the right to forfeit the guarantee if we suspect any abuse of our money back guarantee offer.
<br><br>
<h4 class="fw-bold">Return/Refund Process</h4>
<br><br>
In order to receive a full refund when returning a product to NO-PAIN, you must return any remaining supplements. If your return package is missing items, you still may receive a partial refund. However, if nothing is returned, a refund will not be issued. Your return must be postmarked within the time allotted on the return authorization instructions that are issued to you. Once a return is requested, your account will be deactivated, and you will no longer be able to access your NO-PAIN account. <br><br>
<strong>Please note:</strong> NO-PAIN does not refund shipping costs paid. Packages that are returned within the 60-day timeframe but without a return authorization number and/or packages refused by the customer at the time of delivery will have a return fee deducted from the refund: No-Pain Weight Loss supplements - $12.00 deduction. To ensure proper credit to your account, NO-PAIN recommends that you obtain tracking information on your return package. Please save your shipping receipt until your refund has been received. Refunds are processed within 7 - 10 business days of receipt. Shipping costs are nonrefundable. Credits may take 48-72 hours to appear in your account once they have been processed. This timeframe is determined by your financial institution. Please refer to your financial institution for questions regarding this time frame. NO-PAIN is not responsible for any bank or credit card fees that you may incur. Refunds issued by paper check will be sent via US mail.
<br><br>
<h4 class="fw-bold">Order Cancellation Requests</h4>
<br><br>
All orders are processed in our warehouse immediately after order placement and therefore cancellation requests may not always be accommodated. If we are not able to accommodate your request to cancel an order, the standard return procedure as noted above should be followed in order to receive a refund. 
<br><br>

To this effect, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach such solution within a period of thirty (30) days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, such dispute, claim, question or disagreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Brighton, Michigan, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), subject to the limitations of this Section. This agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable under the prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction. Notice of a demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party hereto and with the AAA. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen, and in no event shall any such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing and shall be final. Judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification, or appeal, except to the extent permitted by Sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of which Sections the parties agree shall apply. The expenses of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the AAA, shall be shared equally by the parties. <br><br>
The arbitrator will have no authority to award attorneys’ fees, punitive damages, or any other monetary relief not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto. The award may include equitable relief. The arbitrator will not make any ruling, finding, or award that does not otherwise conform to the Terms. The arbitrator may render a summary disposition relative to all or some of the issues, provided that the responding party has had an adequate opportunity to respond to any such application for such disposition. <br><br>
The parties agree to treat all aspects of the arbitration as confidential, as provided in the AAA Rules. Before making any disclosure permitted by the Rules, a party shall give written notice to the other party and afford such party a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests. Further, judgment on the arbitrators’ award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. <br><br>
<u>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</u> You and we agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to: (a) your or our intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or (b) your violation of our User Content Posting Guidelines.
<br><br>
<strong>
  Class Action Waiver: Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. You agree that neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, and each party hereby waives any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any disputes subject to arbitration under these Terms or any disputes between the parties. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. <br><br>
Waiver of Jury Trial: Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right we or you may have to a trial by jury for any legal action arising out of or relating to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby.

<u>Governing Law.</u> For all legal proceedings arising out of use of the Website, the Products, or our Services, and/or relating to these Terms, these Terms and the relationship between you and us shall, irrespective of any choice of laws rules, be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.

You and we irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that you may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceeding brought in any such court or any claim that a legal proceeding commenced in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. <br><br>
<u>Assignment.</u> You may not assign, convey, or transfer (whether by contract, merger or operation of law) (collectively, “assign” or variants) these Terms, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld by us in our sole discretion.

Headings. The headings of sections and paragraphs in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect its interpretation. <br><br>
<u>Waiver.</u> The failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not affect our right to exercise or enforce such right or provision at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. <br><br>
<u>Severability.</u> If any portion of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in such provision, and, notwithstanding such finding, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. <br><br>

              <strong>Introduction:</strong> <br><br>
              NO-PAIN CLUB (“<strong>NO-PAIN</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) respects the privacy of our visitors, users,
customers, and members (referred to as “<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”). This privacy policy (and as amended
from time to time as posted on our Website) (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) describes the types of
information we may or do collect from you or that you may provide when you visit or use our
no-pain.works website (“<strong>Website</strong>”) or our mobile app (“<strong>Mobile App</strong>”), purchase or use our
products (by any method) (“<strong>Products</strong>”), or use our services (“<strong>Services</strong>”), and our practices for
collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, disclosing, retaining, and transferring that information.
By “visitors” we mean visitors to our Website who are not yet customers, customers who
purchase off our Website (or by other method) or download and use our Mobile App, as well as
those who do not become customers, whether you upload information to our Website, download
it, or are merely visiting our Website. By “customers” we mean the persons who purchase our
Products or Services. This Privacy Policy applies to you as applicable to the category to which
you belong. This Privacy Policy applies to the data collected by us, or those working on our
behalf, through information you enter or from the data imported from authorized and approved
sources. It does not apply to data collected through other websites, products, or services not
approved by us.
<br><br>
<strong>Acknowledgement and Consent:</strong>
<br><br>
By visiting our Website, using our Mobile App, or by purchasing or using our Products or
Services, you acknowledge that you accept the terms, practices and policies described in this
Privacy Policy (and as updated from time to time), and you hereby consent that we may collect,
use, and share your information as described herein. If you do not agree with our policies and
practices, your choice is not to use our Website or our Products or Services. Your use of the
Website, Mobile App, and our Products and Services is at all times subject to our Terms of Use
(available on our Terms of Use on our Website and as updated from time to time (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”)),
which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms we use in this Privacy Policy
without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms.
<br><br>
<strong>What Information Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong>
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information. Such
information is information which identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of
being associated or linked to a particular person, and may include name, mailing address, email
address, telephone number, and other information (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Please see
additional information below on the information we collect. For this Privacy Policy the definition
of “Personal Information” is the definition under the state, country, or other law applicable to the
person whose data is collected. <br><br>
For California and Virginia residents only, please see the section below entitled “<strong>Privacy Notice
for California and Virginia Residents</strong>” for information on specific rights you have.
<br><br>
We may also collect Personal Information from you through means other than our Website. This
may include offline collection, such as if you submit a paper application, make a payment by
check, money order or other method, or call or visit our office. It may also include emails, text
messages, or other electronic communications that you send to us separate from our Website or
Mobile App or by way of our third party service providers. However, if we combine the Personal
Information we collect from you outside of our Website or Mobile App with Personal
Information that is collected through our Website or Mobile App or by another means as
described above, the Privacy Policy will apply to the combined information, unless specifically
disclosed otherwise. <br><br>
Personal Information does not include information publicly available from government records
or information excluded by applicable law. Personal Information also does not include your
Personal Information that has been deidentified, pseudonymized, anonymized, aggregated,
and/or otherwise processed so as to be unidentifiable in such a way that the data can no longer be
attributed to a specific individual (by reasonable means) without the use of additional
information, and where such additional information is kept separate and under adequate security
to prevent unauthorized re-identification of a specific individual such that one could not, using
reasonable efforts, link such information back to a specific individual (collectively, all of the
foregoing in this sentence being referred to as “<strong>De-Identified Personal Information</strong>”). <br><br>
<strong>Individuals under the Age of 18:</strong>
<br><br>
We do not knowingly collect, solicit or maintain Personal Information from anyone under the
age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for our Services. If you are under 18,
please do not send any Personal Information about yourself (such as your name, address,
telephone number, or email address) to us. No one under age 18 should provide any Personal
Information to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a
child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will use commercially reasonable
efforts to delete that information from our database.
<br><br>
<strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy:</strong> <br><br>
We are constantly working to improve our Website and Services, and we may need to change
this Privacy Policy from time to time as well. Our current Privacy Policy will always be on our
Website and any updates will be effective upon posting. You are responsible for periodically
checking our Website for updates. <br><br>
Please note that if you have opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t
provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the
Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the
Website, purchase Products, or use our Mobile App or Services after any changes to the Privacy
Policy have been posted, that means you agree to the new Privacy Policy, including all of the
changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time
such information is collected. <br><br>
<strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong>

  <strong>Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies.</strong> As you navigate
  through and interact with our Website or Mobile App, we may use automatic data collection
  technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns,
  including:
</p>
<br>
<ul class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
<li> Details of your visits to our Website or use of the Mobile App, including, but not limited

<li> Location data: When applicable, we collect and use IP address and mailing address for

  providers may use geolocation data (via IP address) to automatically display advertising
  on your device based on where you are at a point in time in relation to a particular
  location (for example, a shopping mall). We do not store your momentary geolocation
  data (i.e., time or precise place), though various third parties such as Google may for their
  own purposes, if you have given them permission to do so.  </li>

<p class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">

  anonymous, and at the time of collection, we do not directly associate or attempt to associate this
  information with you as an identifiable individual. If you sign up to receive our emails when

  associate the keystroke and cursor information with the email address you provide. We use this
  information solely for the purpose of improving our Website, Mobile App, Products, and
  Services, and to improve our customers’ user experience. <br><br>
  The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include Personal

web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for
example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related
website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying
system and server integrity). <br><br>
<strong>Pixel Tracking.</strong> In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ “pixel tracking”, a
common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites. Pixel
tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of
computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles
aggregate and specific usage statistics. A “pixel tag” is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of
websites that is used to track an individual user’s activity. We may access these pixel tags to
identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our products, services, and offers
with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on
another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you
to the Website. If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able
to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is
collected for use in our marketing, research, and other activities. <br><br>
<strong>GIF.</strong> We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics
on who opens our emails. <br><br>

<strong>IP Address.</strong> Our servers (or those of our service providers) may automatically record certain log
file information reported from your browser when you access the Website. These server logs
may include information such as which pages of the Website you visited, your internet protocol
(“IP”) address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Website. These
log files are generally deleted periodically. <br><br>
<strong>Information We Collect from Third Parties</strong>
<br><br>
We may collect information that others provide about you when you use the Website or Mobile
App, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect
through the Website and Mobile App.
<br><br>
</p> <br>
<ul class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
<li> <strong>Third Party Services.</strong> If you link, connect, or login to your account with a third-party
  social media service (e.g., Facebook, Google, Instagram, Yelp, etc.), the third party
  service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from
  that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by
  you via your privacy settings at that service. </li>
<li><strong> Other Sources.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional
  information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from
  third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have
  about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings
  from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk
  assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off
  the Website and Mobile App through partnerships, or about your experiences and
  interactions from our partner ad networks. </li>

  We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will

  custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Services and

 <strong> Social Media Plugins</strong> <br><br>
We may integrate social media application program interfaces or plugins (“plugins”) from social
networks, including Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, X-Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr,
Pinterest and/or possibly other companies, into the Website or Mobile App. In order to register
as a user with us, you may have the option to sign in using your Facebook or other social media
site login. <br><br>
For example, when you visit our Website, the plugin creates a direct connection between your
browser and the Facebook server. This allows Facebook to receive information about your visit
to our Website with your IP address. If you click the Facebook “Like” button while you are
logged on to your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our Website to your Facebook
profile. This allows Facebook to assign your visit to our Website to your user account. Please
note that as provider of the Website, we receive no notification about the contents of the
transmitted data or their use by Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign your visit to
our Website to your Facebook user account, please log out of your Facebook user account. <br><br>

your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, relationships, interests,
current city, photos, personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your
social media site friends who might be common social media site friends with other users.
Plugins may transfer information about you to the plugin’s respective platform without action by
you. This information may include your platform user identification number, which website you
are on, and more. Interacting with a plugin will transmit information directly to that plugin’s
social network and that information may be visible by others on that platform. Plugins are
controlled by the respective platform’s privacy policy, and not by our Privacy Policy. You can
find the privacy policy for a platform on their website. <br><br>

  Required Disclosures: Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose
  your Personal Information to any third party unless required to do so by law, court order, legal
  process, or subpoena, including to respond to any government or regulatory request, or if we

providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an
individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon us, our users, our Website, Mobile
App, or our Services. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these
reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact if we determine in
good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no risk scenarios
described in this paragraph apply. <br><br>
It is likely that the identity and categories of such third parties will change during the life of your
account. We require that our third-party service providers only use your Personal Information as
necessary to provide the requested services to us and each service provider is subject to a set of

purpose of considering or undergoing a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization,
dissolution, change in control, or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets (each of the
foregoing referred to as a “<strong>Transfer</strong>”), whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy,
liquidation or other court proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us is among the

Transferred Information that we may have in the event of our bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, receivership, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Furthermore, except as

signing off after you have finished accessing your account. If your email account or Facebook
account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given up
those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is
compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with
us. If you think that any of your accounts have been compromised you should change your
account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not
allow access to your account with us. The information you share in public areas may be viewed
by other users. We will never email you to ask for your password or other account login
information. If you receive such an email, please send it to us so we can investigate. <br><br>

<strong>Privacy Notice for California and Virginia Residents</strong>
The following in this section applies to California residents, but certain aspects may also apply to
residents of Virginia or of other states, depending on your state’s laws. <br><br>
<em>California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”, also known as the “Shine the Light”
  law; Calif. Bus. & Prof. Code § 22575-22578:</em> CalOPPA applies only to companies which

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. CalOPPA requires us to let you know how we
respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy
preference you can set in your web browser to indicate that you do not want certain information
about your webpage visits collected across websites when you have not interacted with that
service on the page. For details, including how to turn on Do Not Track, see www.donottrack.us.
Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard recognizing or honoring DNT signals,
we don’t respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community
and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
Visitors can visit our Website anonymously by adjusting the settings in your browser. <br><br>

  See below on how California and Virginia residents (and those of other states) can exercise these
  rights.
  <br><br>
  <strong>However, NO-PAIN has established the policy that we will honor all of these rights’
    requests of anyone, not just California residents.</strong> <br><br>
The categories of your Personal Information we collect are listed above in the section entitled
“Personal Information We Collect.” The purposes for which the categories of Personal
Information are or may be used is described above in the section entitled “How We Use Your
Information” and in other sections of this Privacy Policy. <br><br>
You have the right to request no more than twice in a 12-month period that we disclose certain
information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12
months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable Consumer request, we will disclose to
you: <br><br>
</p>

<ul class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  <li> The categories of Personal Information we collected about you. </li>
  <li> The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.</li>
  <li> Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information. </li>
  <li> The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information. </li>
  <li> The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data
    portability request) and provide a copy to you in an electronic or paper format. </li>
  <li> If we disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, a list disclosing
    disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that
    each category of recipient obtained. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  Deletion Request Right <br><br>
  You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected
  from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your
  verifiable Consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your
  Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies (as described below). <br><br>
  As permitted by CPRA we may delete your Personal Information by (a) permanently and
  completely erasing the Personal Information on our existing systems with the exception of
  archived or back-up systems; (b) de-identifying the Personal Information; or, (c) aggregating the
  Personal Information. <br><br>
  We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our Service
  Provider(s) to: <br><br>
</p>
<ul class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  <li> Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a
    good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context
    of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with
    you. </li>
  <li> Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
    activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. </li>
  <li> Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. </li>
  <li> Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech
    rights, or exercise another right provided for by law. </li>
  <li> Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code §
    1546 et. seq.). </li>
  <li> Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based
    on your relationship with us. </li>
  <li> Comply with a legal, regulatory or law enforcement obligation. </li>
  <li> Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the
    context in which you provided it. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights <br><br>
  To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a
  verifiable Consumer request to us by sending an email to us at support@no-pain.works or by
  using our webform when available. Only you, or a person registered with the California
  Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable Consumer
  request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable Consumer request
  on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable Consumer request for access or
  data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable Consumer request must: 
</p>
<br>
<ul class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  <li> Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person
    about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative; and, </li>
  <li> Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
    evaluate, and respond to it. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify
  your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to
  you. Making a verifiable Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
  We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable Consumer request to verify the
  requestor's identity or authority to make the request. <br><br>
  Verification Process<br><br>
Upon receiving a data access or deletion request from you we will send an email to you at the
email address we have for you on file. The email will ask you to respond to verify you as the
Consumer making the request. Upon receipt of your verification we will match your information to that which is in our file. Upon verification of your identity we will proceed to process your
request (subject to the exceptions stated above). <br><br>

Response Timing and Format <br><br>
We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days of receiving it. We will
respond to a verifiable Consumer request within forty-five (45) calendar days of its receipt. If we
require more time (up to an additional forty-five (45) calendar days), we will inform you of the
reason and extension period in writing. <br><br>
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do
not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at our
option. <br><br>
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
Consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to
provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. <br><br>
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable Consumer request unless it is
excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee,
we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
completing your request. <br><br>
Please note that this right does not if the disclosure of Personal Information is for purposes
consistent with the California resident’s reasonable expectations, when considering the
submission’s circumstances. <br><br>
<strong>Exercising Appeal Rights (Virginia Residents Only)</strong> <br><br>
If we refuse to take action on a request, you may appeal our decision by submitting an appeal
request. Please refer to the communication you received from us refusing your request for
additional information you may need to provide in making you appeal request. Within sixty (60)
days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in
response to your appeal. If the appeal is denied, we will provide you with an online mechanism
or other method though which you may contact the Virginia Attorney General to submit a
complaint. To submit an appeal, please email us at support@no-pain.works. <br><br>
Non-Discrimination <br><br>
We will not discriminate against you simply for your exercising any of your CPRA rights.
Unless permitted by the CPRA, we will not: 
</p>
<br>
<ul class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">
  <li> Deny you goods or services; </li>
  <li> Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including by refusing to grant
    discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
     </li>
  <li> Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or, </li>
  <li> Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
    level or quality of goods or services. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="text-black" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.15;">

  If you are a citizen or resident of the UK, European Economic Area, Switzerland, or other
  regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from the laws in the United
  States, please note that we may transfer your information to a country or jurisdiction that does
  not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. We may do so to process your
